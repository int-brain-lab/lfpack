## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- `LFPackReader.channels` and `LFPackReader.channels_full` — per-channel probe geometry
  and brain location annotations (`x/y/z` MNI coordinates, `atlas_id`, `acronym`).
  Brain location fields are optional; the properties work on any existing file.
  `channels` aggregates over binned-channel groups (mean for coordinates, mode for
  brain region); `channels_full` always returns the raw per-electrode data.
- `compress_to_h5` accepts an optional `channels` dict to embed brain location
  annotations at compression time.
